Explains briefly what could be considered a Micro frontend when using Module Federation and shows a demo with Angular. Most notably does this in under 45 minutes, compared to the Udemy course [Microfrontends with React: A Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/microfrontend-course/learn/lecture/23206924) which is quite dry and takes 9 hours.
