## Kafka Streams in Action by Bill Bejeck
I’m not really a fan of “in Action” books as the quality is usually not very high and this was the case with this book too. It was poorly edited and it although it contained some information that you can’t easily get from the documentation, I think reading the Kafka Streams documentation (which is quite good by the way) is a better way to spend your time. What I’m missing from both is a detailed description on
- how Kafka Streams works internally
- how to write your own advanced processors (and gotchas)
