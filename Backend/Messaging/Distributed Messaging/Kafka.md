## Kafka: The Definitive Guide by Neha Narkhede
For the most part, I liked the book. It spends some time explaining the internals of Kafka and uses that to explain how to use all those configuration properties (that sometimes intimidate me). It also discusses on a very high-level a multi-datacenter replication set-up, Kafka Connect and Kafka Streams.
