# OCP Study Guide by Boyarsky and Selikoff
A super thick book (~1200 pages), and the content is just astounding: all-inclusive, very completed but still entertaining to read. Highly recommended, not only for preparing for OCP exams but also for those who are looking for deeper understanding of Java.
