## Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
Big but extremely thorough intro into functional programming, without being a course on function programming at all. You will also learn a couple of mathematical foundations of programming.
(Roberto) Provides a fundamental, almost philosophical, view on computer science, with a higher emphasis on functional programming due to the choice of the taught language (Scheme, a Lisp dialect). The book reaches its climax when it explains how to write an interpreter for Lisp using Lisp (meta-circular evaluator).
