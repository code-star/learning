# Codestar Learning

## Goal

We'd like to provide **a curated list of learning resources to learn about any topic**.

Curated means that you must have read/watched/studied a resource before adding it. Please provide a review detailing why you liked a resource and for who it will be suitable. For example:

> ## FP Simplified by Alvin Alexander
> As the book title, FP Simplified explains the FP concepts and its buzzwords in plain English. Pick this first before touching the Red Book.
> 
> Read by:
> * Tammy (recommended)

## Folder structure 

Folder structure like:

```
Backend/Functional Programming.md
Backend/Functional Programming/Monad.md
```

General knowledge about Functional Programming can be added to `Backend/Functional Programming.md` while more specific subjecs can be addressed in `Backend/Functional Programming/Monad.md`.
